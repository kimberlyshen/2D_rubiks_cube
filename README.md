2D_rubiks_cube
==============

2-D version of a two-by-two Rubik’s cube written in Verilog.

. The goals of the project were the following:
•	Simulate the six possible rotations of the cube and display the action on the VGA monitor 
•	Be able to reset the cube to a solved state 
•	Randomize the cube legally in such a way that it can definitely be solved 
•	Have the user solve the Rubik’s cube by using the switches to rotate the faces 
•	Indicate when the Rubik’s cube has been solved 
•	Debounce input switches
